                         Scientific Calculator

Introduction

* Scientific calculator are use to calculate exponents, log, natural log (ln), modulus functions and basic arithmetic calculations. 
* It is use to Calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics.


SWOT Analysis

*1 Strength
   The ultimate strength of the Calculators is its innovative and user-friendly.
   Most of the maths problems can be solved using this calculator.
   
*2 WEAKNESSES
   The calculator which we are making does not perform all sort of problem such trigonometric functions.
   It can perform only 10 types of functions.
   
*3 OPPORTUNITIES  
   We have the opportunities to increase the number of functions.
   
*4 THREATS
   The calculator can be stuck in a infinite loop sometime.
   
   
   
   4W's and 1'H
   
   Who
   Small and simple type is the moto for calculation
   
   What
   Trying to make scientific calculator in c
   
   When 
   it is needed to solve basic maths problems
   
   Where
    This problem are everywhere which is needed to ne solved.
    
   How
   We are trying to make the calculator with the help of c language.
