                         Scientific Calculator

Introduction

* A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our         calculations easier and faster. It is a portable device that can use anywhere to perform simple mathematical operations. We use a scientific or sophisticated calculator in some   situations, where we need to solve complex calculations like trigonometry functions, exponential operators, degrees, radians, log functions, hyperbolic functions etc. 
* Scientific calculator are use to calculate exponents, log, natural log (ln), modulus functions and basic arithmetic calculations. 
* It is use to Calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics.

Advantages 

* Calculator can solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner.
* Computations done via calculators are more accurate to the ones done by humans.
